# Chora Club - NFT Distribution Documentation

## Introduction

Chora Club is our DAO Education DApp designed to facilitate interactions between experienced delegates and new users entering the world of web3 and DAOs. To acknowledge and incentivize participation, we reward both the educating delegates and the new users with NFTs which would be helpful to network and DAOs if they want to reward or run a AirDrop program.

## Why NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within Chora Club serve as a unique and valuable way to acknowledge and reward contributions within our DAO community. The use of NFTs provides the following advantages:

- **Uniqueness:** Each NFT is distinct, representing the unique contributions made by users and delegates.
- **Ownership:** NFTs are securely owned by the recipients, fostering a sense of ownership and pride.

- **Interoperability:** NFTs can be easily integrated into other platforms and marketplaces, allowing users to showcase their achievements beyond the Chora Club ecosystem.

## Reasons Behind Rewarding

Chora Club rewards both new users and delegates for the following reasons:

- **Encouraging Participation:** Incentivizing participation encourages active involvement in the educational process, fostering a vibrant and engaged community.

- **Recognition:** By providing NFTs, we recognize and celebrate the efforts of both delegates and new users in advancing their knowledge of web3 and DAOs.

- **Building Community:** The distribution of NFTs contributes to the creation of a strong and supportive community, where members feel valued and acknowledged.

- **Blockchain Network or DAO Rewards:** Chora Club NFTs serve as a means for blockchain networks or DAOs to reward their users based on their active participation. Holding Chora Club NFTs can demonstrate a user's early adoption or ongoing contribution to the network or DAO, making them eligible for additional rewards. This system helps networks and DAOs acknowledge and appreciate users who play a crucial role in the growth of the ecosystem.

  - **Airdrop Programs:** Chora Club NFTs are particularly useful for networks or DAOs looking to run airdrop programs. The uniqueness and ownership features of NFTs make them an ideal reward mechanism for airdrops, fostering widespread engagement and community growth.

## Ways to Give Users NFT

1. **Direct Transfer to EOA Address:**

   - Simple and straightforward, directly transferring NFTs to the user's externally owned account (EOA) address by running the script (Automatic process)(less acknowledgement).

2. **Claiming NFTs After the Call:**
   - Users can claim their NFTs post-call through various methods, providing flexibility and convenience (have to claim by signing the message) (more acknowledgement).

## Claim Path Options

1. **API Script for Minting:**

   - Efficiently use an API script to mint NFTs on the user's address.
   - Developing an API which will mint the NFT on the given address and will be managed by Chora Club.
